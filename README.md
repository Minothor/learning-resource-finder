This is a backup of the ToujoursPlus platform.
This was a project led by educator and author John Rizzo and developed over the course of 2 and a half years.
This backup serves the dual functions of preserving the code after Google Code closes definitively and providing the collective authors with evidence of the work and it's progression over time.
